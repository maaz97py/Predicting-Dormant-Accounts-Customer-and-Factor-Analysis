## H2 What is a Dormant Account?

Before finding out the factors influencing dormancy it is important to understand the definition of a dormant account. Let me make it simple for you. When an account has no transactions for 12 months, it is considered inactive. If there is no activity for 24 months, it is deemed dormant. Remember, system-generated activities like interest credits don't count. A “transaction” is an activity initiated by the account holder.
